## Installation

To get started with INJ, follow these steps:

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
 
<Steps>
<Step>
### Install Node.js
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) - the runtime environment required for INJ
</Step>
 
<Step>
### Download INJ
Download [INJ](https://github.com/adyingdeath/INJ/releases/latest) for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
</Step>

<Step>
Extract the downloaded file
</Step>

<Step>
Navigate to the INJ root directory (where `package.json` is located)
</Step>

<Step>
Run `node install.js` in your terminal to set up INJ
</Step>

</Steps>

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';
 
<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="If you encounter any issues with install.js">
You need to install manually.

In the INJ root directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then add INJ root directory to your PATH environment variable
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

After installation, you can use the `inj` command from any directory in your terminal.

## File Structure

INJ follows the same file structure as Minecraft datapacks. Your source directory (typically named `src`) mirrors the structure of a datapack's `data` folder:

```
src/
├─<your_namespace>
│  ├─advancements
│  ├─functions
│  │  ├─test.inj
│  │  └─hello.inj
│  ├─loot_tables
│  ├─recipes
│  └─tags
└─minecraft
    ├─dimension
    ├─dimension_type
    ├─loot_tables
    └─tags
```

Place your `src` directory alongside the `data` folder in your datapack. Edit files directly in `src`, then compile using:

```bash
inj <src_directory>          # Basic compilation
inj <src_directory> -o <output_directory>    # Specify output directory
inj <src_directory> --watch  # Watch mode: auto-compile on changes
```

## INJ Syntax

INJ enhances Minecraft functions by allowing you to write JavaScript code alongside Minecraft commands. While knowing JavaScript can help you unlock INJ's full potential, you only need to understand a few basic concepts to get started:

- [if statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
- [while loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) and [for loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)
- [let declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
- [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

### Running Minecraft Commands

You can directly write Minecraft commands in any line of your INJ code:

```js
if (2 != 1) {
    // This line is a Minecraft command that does not require modification
    say "2 is not equal to 1"
}
```

You can also use `INJ.run()` to execute Minecraft commands. This function is particularly useful when you need to incorporate JavaScript variables into your commands:

```js
// Basic usage
INJ.run(`say Hello, world!`);

// Using JavaScript variables
const playerName = "Steve";
INJ.run(`tell ${playerName} Welcome!`);

// Creating patterns with loops
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    INJ.run(`setblock ~${i} ~ ~${i} minecraft:stone`);
}
```

### Advanced Example: Creating Shapes

Here's how to create a circle of arrows using JavaScript math functions:

```js
// Create a circle of arrows with radius 10
const radius = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    const angle = (i / 100) * 2 * Math.PI;
    const x = (Math.cos(angle) * radius).toFixed(2);
    const z = (Math.sin(angle) * radius).toFixed(2);
    INJ.run(`summon minecraft:arrow ~${x} ~ ~${z}`);
}
```

### Conditional Logic

You can use `if` statements to add conditional logic to your code. The conditions can be written in pure JavaScript syntax. For Minecraft-specific conditions, write them as JavaScript strings, such as `"block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:air"` or `"score @r inj_score = 3"`.

There are three ways to write conditions:

1. `if (<minecraft_condition>) {}`
2. `if (<js_condition>) {}`
3. `if (<minecraft_condition>.and(<js_condition>)) {}`

Note: You can use either `and()` or `or()` to combine conditions.

The rest of the `if` statement syntax follows standard JavaScript conventions.

```js
// Minecraft condition
if ("block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:stone") {
    INJ.run(`tellraw @s ["Found a stone block!"]`);
}

// JavaScript condition
if (a % 2 == 0) {
    say "a is even"
}

// Combined conditions using .and() or .or()
if ("block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:stone".and(a % 2 == 0)) {
    say "Here is a stone and 'a' is even!"
}
```

### Loops

While INJ supports both `for` and `while` loops, `while` loops currently only work with JavaScript conditions:

```js
let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
    INJ.run(`say Count: ${count}`);
    count++;
}
```

*We will be supporting mixed JavaScript and Minecraft conditions for while loops in the future.*


Here's another example showing how to create a line of stone using a for loop:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    INJ.run(`setblock ~${i} ~ ~${i} minecraft:stone`);
}
```

And an arrow circle:

```js
// Create a circle of arrows with radius 10
const radius = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    const angle = (i / 100) * 2 * Math.PI;
    const x = (Math.cos(angle) * radius).toFixed(2);
    const z = (Math.sin(angle) * radius).toFixed(2);
    INJ.run(`summon minecraft:arrow ~${x} ~ ~${z}`);
}
```
