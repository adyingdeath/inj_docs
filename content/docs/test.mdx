# Development

Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript.

Use `node dist/inj.js` to test the command line functionality. This works the same way as using the `inj` command directly in your terminal.

# Getting Started

- First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) - this is the runtime environment required for INJ.
- Navigate to the INJ root directory (where `package.json` is located) and run `npm install` in your terminal to install all the dependencies INJ needs.
- After installing, add the INJ root directory to your PATH environment variable.
- Now, you can use the `inj` command from any directory in your terminal.

# Usage

While INJ's syntax includes JavaScript elements, you can still use it effectively even with minimal JavaScript knowledge. However, we recommend familiarizing yourself with some basic JS concepts. At minimum, it's helpful to understand:

- [if statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), [while loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while), and [for loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)
- [let declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
- [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

These basic concepts will allow you to accomplish a lot with INJ. If you want to unlock its full potential, you can learn more at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Syntax

INJ enhances Minecraft functions by introducing powerful new features. It allows you to write JavaScript code directly alongside your Minecraft commands in mcfunction files.

### INJ.run

The special function `INJ.run(minecraft_command: string)` executes Minecraft commands at the specified position. This is particularly useful for incorporating JavaScript variables into your Minecraft commands. For example:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    INJ.run(`setblock ~${i} ~ ~${i} minecraft:stone`);
}
```

You can also use more complex JavaScript expressions within the template literals:

```
// Create a circle of arrows with radius 10
const radius = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    INJ.run(`summon minecraft:arrow ~${(Math.cos(i / 100 * 2 * Math.PI) * radius).toFixed(2)} ~ ~${(Math.sin(i / 100 * 2 * Math.PI) * radius).toFixed(2)}`);
}
```

- x coordinate: `(Math.cos(i / 100 * 2 * Math.PI) * radius).toFixed(2)`
- y coordinate: `(Math.sin(i / 100 * 2 * Math.PI) * radius).toFixed(2)`

The `toFixed(2)` method is used to round the numbers to two decimal places.

### if Statements

You can use `if` statements to add conditional logic to your code. The conditions can be written in pure JavaScript syntax. For Minecraft-specific conditions, write them as JavaScript strings, such as `"block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:air"` or `"score @r inj_score = 3"`.

There are three ways to write conditions:

1. `if (<minecraft_condition>) {}`
2. `if (<js_condition>) {}`
3. `if (<minecraft_condition>.and(<js_condition>)) {}`

Note: You can use either `and()` or `or()` to combine conditions.

The rest of the `if` statement syntax follows standard JavaScript conventions.

Examples:

```
if ("block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:stone") {
    tellraw @s ["Here is a stone"]
} else {
    tellraw @s ["Here is not a stone"]
}
```

```
if ("block ~ ~ ~ minecraft:stone".and(1 != 2)) {
    tellraw @s ["Here is a stone and 1 is not equal to 2"]
}
```

### while Loops

Currently, `while` loops only support JavaScript conditions, not Minecraft conditions.

```
let i = 0;
while (i % 2 == 0 && i < 10) {
    tellraw @a "Hello World!"
}
```

## Command Line

```
Usage: inj [options] <directory>

Compiler for your project

Arguments:
  directory            source directory

Options:
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -o, --output <path>  output path
  -w, --watch          watch mode
  -h, --help           display help for command
```

The source directory is where you save your source code, whose structure is as follows:

```
src
├─<your_namespace>
│  ├─advancements
│  ├─functions
│  │  ├─test.mcfunction
│  │  └─hello.mcfunction
│  ├─loot_tables
│  ├─recipes
│  └─tags
└─minecraft
    ├─dimension
    ├─dimension_type
    ├─loot_tables
    └─tags
```

It is actually the same as the structure of `data` folder in a Minecraft datapack.
